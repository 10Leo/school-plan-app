Improvements
* store the plans in app
* reload all at will

Realization:
using localStorage to store keys and plans
add a "reload plans" icon

Refactoring:
* getDateNames is called for each plan reloaded. As this doesn't change it should 
  be loaded only ones
* if id changed - plan is added again 
  id isn't needed it should be a hashtag
