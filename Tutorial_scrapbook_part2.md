# Make a simple app work for others too.

This is a continuation of a previous tutorial. 

## Story

I've got two kids with a different school plans. We're using iOS and Android devices to follow them. Others have seen the benefits and would like to have such apps as well.

## What will be build

A mobile application which will:

(*Copied from previous chapter*)

1. Display school plan(s). 
2. Work offline
3. Work on many platforms

(*New goal*)

4. Download school plans from a server

## Prerequisites

* Creating apps using Cordova.
* Mozilla Brick

> Please read <A href="https://github.com/zalun/school-plan-app/blob/master/README.md">instructions</a> how to load any stage in this tutorial.

## Preparation

I assume Cordova and Bower are installed and working

## Stage 5

See code on <a href="https://github.com/zalun/school-plan-app/tree/master/stage5">GitHub</a>

> I call it a stage 5 because it really is a continuation.

### Improvements

* Modify the school plan app to work with data instead of the plain HTML

### Realization

Remove old data from ```www/index.html``` leaving only the minimal structure. Certainly this also could be created using JavaScript, but I think it's better to have some HTML.

```html
<brick-tabbar id="plan-group-menu">
</brick-tabbar>
<brick-deck id="plan-group">
</brick-deck>
```

To prepare for data being pulled from another system there is a need to have a way to read them. Most common data structure used in JavaScript project is JSON.

For now it's OK to distribute the school plan together with the app, It's gonna be much easier to modify it for others as well, as editing data file is simple.

I've placed the data in ```www/data/plans.json``` file. It contains an ```Array``` of plans. Plan is an ```Object``` containing ```title```, ```id``` optional ```active``` field and ```weeek```, an actual plan which is an ```Array``` of ```String```s. (*Note: use jshint to check the quality of your code*)

```js
[
    {
      "title": "Name of the plan",
      "id": "id-of-the-plan",
      "active": 1,  // should the plan be the active one?
      "week": [
        [
          "first hour",
          "second hour",
          "third",
		  // ... and so on
        [],  // no activities on Wednesday
        ], [
          "",
          "",
          "starting on third",
          "fourth"
        ]
    }
]
```


Now there is a need to read this JSON file from the app's directory. 

> Previously I planned to use Cordova's <a href="http://plugins.cordova.io/#/package/org.apache.cordova.file">FileSystem plugin</a>, but it only made the code more complicated.

As both cards and tabs do not exist at the moment of loading the JavaScript file I've removed from ```www/js/index.js``` part where these were linked together.

I'm using a standard ```XMLHttpRequest```

```js     
var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.onload = app.renderData;
request.open("get", "app_data/plans.json", true);
request.send();
```

Where ```app.renderData``` parses the JSON and sends data to ```app.createUI``` so UI will be created on its basis.

```js
renderData: function() {
    var plans = [];
    try {
        plans = JSON.parse(this.responseText);
    } catch(e) {}
    app.createUI(plans);
},
```

To create the UI we will need weekday names. The best option is to use Cordova's <a href="https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-globalization/blob/master/doc/index.md">Globalization plugin</a>.

    cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.globalization
    
Week days are retrieved using ```navigator.globalization.getDateNames```:
    
```js
createUI: function(plans) {
    var deck = document.getElementById('plan-group');
    var tabbar = document.getElementById('plan-group-menu');        
    navigator.globalization.getDateNames(function(dayOfWeek){
    // render UI
    }, function() {}, {type: 'narrow', item: 'days'});
```
```dayOfWeek``` will hold an ```Array``` of week day names. In my case ```['Pn', 'Wt', 'Åšr', 'Cz', 'Pt']```. If you'd like to use full day names, just change ```type: 'narrow'``` to ```type: 'wide'```.

Now there is a need to create individual plans. This time ```brick-tabbar-tab``` and ```brick-card``` elements are created using JavaScript. Tab refers to the right card using its ```target``` parameter. It has the same value as card's ```id```. Brick will parse this value and create a ```tab.targetElement``` which will link to the card element.

```js
for (var i = 0; i < plans.length; i++) {
    var plan = plans[i];
    
    // create card
    var card = document.createElement('brick-card');
    card.setAttribute('id', plan.id);
    deck.appendChild(card); 
    
    //create tab
    var tab = document.createElement('brick-tabbar-tab');
    tab.setAttribute('target', plan.id);
    tab.appendChild(document.createTextNode(plan.title));
    tabbar.appendChild(tab);

    // link card to tab
    card.tabElement = tab;
    card.addEventListener('show', function() {
        this.tabElement.select();
    });
     
    // create plan table
    var table = document.createElement('table');

    // ...
}
```

First we will create actual plan elements and then the header. It is because ```table.insertRow()``` either creates a new ```tbody``` and ```tr``` inside or adds a row to any existing ```HTMLTableSectionElement``` (```thead``` if already created). We could call ```table.tBodies(0)``` but it would complicate the code.

There is a problem to be solved - we're representing the plan in data as we understood it - hours inside days. Unfortunately tables in HTML are created row by row (days inside hours) which means the array needs to be rotated

```js
var daysInHours = [];
for (var j = 0; j < plan.week.length; j++) {
    for (var k = 0; k < plan.week[j].length; k++) {
        if (!daysInHours[k]) {
            daysInHours[k] = [];
        }
        daysInHours[k][j] = plan.week[j][k];
    }
}
```

Now ```daysInHours``` array can be easily used to render the plan into HTML table. There is an important note - ```table.insertRow``` needs to use the optional index, as by default Android inserts the row on top:

```js
for (var j = 0; j < daysInHours.length; j++) {
    var tr = table.insertRow(-1);
    var td = tr.insertCell();
    td.appendChild(document.createTextNode(j + 1));
    for (var k = 0; k < daysInHours[j].length; k++) {
        var td = tr.insertCell();
        if (daysInHours[j][k]) {
            td.appendChild(document.createTextNode(daysInHours[j][k]));
        }
    }
}
```

Table needs a header:
```js
var thead = table.createTHead();
var tr = thead.insertRow();
var th_empty = document.createElement('th');
tr.appendChild(th_empty);
for (var j = 0; j < daysInHours.length; j++) {
    // add th only if day isn't empty
    if (plan.week[j]) {
        var th = document.createElement('th');
        th.appendChild(document.createTextNode(dayOfWeek.value[j]));
        tr.appendChild(th);
    }
}
```

Table needs to be placed inside ```brick-card``` element:

```js
card.appendChild(table);
```

The right tab needs to be selected when the app is loaded:

```js
if (plan.active) {
    var activeTab = tab;
    window.setTimeout(function() {activeTab.select()}, 0);
}
```

The result is almost the same as in Stage4. The only difference being short weekday names.

### Bug fixing

Short after I've seen the app working I've found few issues: 

1. If the last days are shorter than the first ones ```td``` element is not created and background is not visible. 
2. The second comes from globalization. I started the week with Monday and I was collecting it's name from weekday array using index 0. It's fine for Polish calendar, but not so good for English one.
3. Empty day was displayed. This would be bad for students who attend to the school at the weekend
4. On Android the first ```card``` is not displayed "on load", one needs to slide the card to make it visible

#### Fix 2. Wrong day of the week displayed
I decided to use ```navigator.globalization.getFirstDayOfWeek``` and on the basis of its result shift the days. I'm counting the days from Monday as it's the most common case at schools.

```js
navigator.globalization.getDateNames(function(dayOfWeek){
    navigator.globalization.getFirstDayOfWeek(function(firstDay){
        var dayShift = (1 - firstDay.value) % 7;
```

and instead of using the index I shifted it by ```dayShift``` when displaying ```th``` elements:

```js
th.appendChild(document.createTextNode(dayOfWeek.value[j + dayShift]));
```

#### Fix 3. Do not display empty days

This is divided into two sections. First the header. I was checking if the day is empty with 

```js
if (plan.week[j]) {
    // render the day name
}
```

Instead I should check if the day's array length is greater than 0:

```js
if (plan.week[j].length > 0) {
    // render the day name
}
```

After we've rendered the header it is not needed to know the week day inside the plan. Only the order is important. So, fixing displaying the actual plan involved deleting empty days from array.

```js
var cleanPlan = [];
for (j = 0; j < numberOfDays; j++) {
    if (plan.week[j].length > 0) {
        cleanPlan.push(plan.week[j]);
    }
}
```
And using the ```cleanPlan``` instead of ```plan.week``` when rotating the table.


#### Fix 1. Not all td's rendered

After the table is rotated number of days in hours might be shorter than all days. So when iterating inside the row I decided to use ```cleanPlan.length``` instead of ```daysInHours[j].length```:

```js
for (var j = 0; j < daysInHours.length; j++) {
    var tr = table.insertRow(-1);
    // ...
    for (var k = 0; k < cleanPlan.length; k++) {
        var td = tr.insertCell();
        // ...
```

#### Fix 4. Card is invisible on load

Seems like the selection of the ```tabbar``` happens before it's been attached to the ```card```. I've changed 

```js
window.setTimeout(function() {activeTab.select()}, 0);
```

To

```js
if (plan.active) {
    selectTab(tab);
}
```

where ```selectTab``` is using polling for ```activeTab.targetElement``` to detect if Brick already linked tab with cards:

```js
function selectTab(activeTab) {
    function selectActiveTab() {
        if (!activeTab.targetElement) {
            return window.setTimeout(selectActiveTab, 100);
        }
        deck.showCard(activeTab.targetElement);
    }
    selectActiveTab();
}
```
